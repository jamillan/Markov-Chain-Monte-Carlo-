    "Mutation of nucleotides may be modeled based on specift transition probabilitiyes to perform nucleotide-to-nucleotide mutations. One can imagince that hte the probability of substituing A by C in the DNA Chan may be prescribed as (say) 0.4. One needs to construct a transition probability to be able to describe all the possible mutations laong the DNA chainge. This statistical evolution is known as a Markov process or Markov chain.\n",
    "The module I developed (MC) permits to change the DNA chains with a Markov Chain method,a process that can be  described as follows:\n",
    "(1) We first create a DNA chain AGTGTT.. \n",
